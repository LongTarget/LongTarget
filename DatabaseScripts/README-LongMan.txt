Overview of the scripts in this directory

The scripts in this directory were written using Python and Perl, which can be runned directly without compilation, 
for building a MySQL database. The running time varies greatly with the size of import data. A brief description 
of each script is given below.

 
###########################################################
gtf2db.pl

This script is designed to extract the annotations of human lncRNAs and their transcripts from GENCODE 
gtf file, mainly including their genomic addresses and Ensembl IDs, and import them into three created MySQL 
tables (tb_gene, tb_exon, and tb_transcript) respectively. The corresponding table structures can be 
obtained easily from the script.

Usage: perl gtf2db.pl


###########################################################
updategene2db.pl

This script is designed to extract gene sequences of human lncRNAs from hg19 genome files, and 
import them into the sequence field of tb_gene table.

Usage: perl updategene2db.pl


###########################################################
myexon2db.pl

Many lncRNAs have more than one transcript. The exons belonging to different transcripts may be located in 
different genomic positions but with overlap existing. This script is designed to merge these overlapping 
exons of different transcripts into one full sequence, and import them into the created table (tb_myexon).
The corresponding table structures can be obtained easily from the script.

Usage: perl myexon2db.pl


###########################################################
update_lncRNA_sequence.py

This script is designed to extract merged human lncRNA transcript sequences from hg19 genome files, and 
import them into lncRNA_sequence field of tb_gene table.

Usage: python update_lncRNA_sequence.py


###########################################################
homology_exon2db.py

This script is designed to import the orthologous exons of human lncRNAs, including their genomic 
addresses and sequences, into the created MySQL table(tb_homology_exon). The corresponding table structures 
can be obtained easily from the script.

Usage: python homology_exon2db.py


###########################################################
update_homoGene.py

This script is designed to extract orthologous exon sequences from tb_homology_exon, merge them into corresponding 
orthologous lncRNA sequences, and import them into the created table(tb_homology_gene). The corresponding table 
structures can be obtained easily from the script.

Usage: python update_homoGene.py


###########################################################
cmalign2db.py, tb_cmalign_view2.py

The cmalign2db.py is designed to extract the aligned sequence of human lncRNAs and their orthologues, generated by cmalign 
program, and import them into the created table(tb_cmalign). The tb_cmalign_view2.py is used to enhance tb_cmalign, making it 
suitable to display in website. The corresponding table structures can be obtained easily from the scripts.

Usage: python cmalign2db.py, python cmalign2db.py


###########################################################
insert-TFO-TTS.py, update_TFO.py

Both the scripts are designed to insert the LongTarget-predicted lncRNA's TFOs/TTSs into the created tables 
(tb_gene, tb_homology_exon, and tb_cmalign_view2).

Usage: python insert-TFO-TTS.py, python update_TFO.py


###########################################################
transposon2db.py, checktransposon.pl

Both the scripts are designed to extract information of transposon elements located in human lncRNAs and their orthologues, 
mainly including genomic addresses and their types, and import them into the created table(tb_transposon). The corresponding 
table structures can be obtained easily from the scripts.

Usage: python transposon2db.py, perl checktransposon.pl


###########################################################
insert_alias.py, lncrnadb2db.py

The two scripts are designed to extract the information of human lncRNAs in www.lncRNAdb.org database, and import them 
into the created table(tb_alias). The corresponding table structures can be obtained easily from the scripts.

Usage: python insert_alias.py, python lncrnadb2db.py
